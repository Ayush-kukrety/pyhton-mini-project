Key Components
Extracting Audio from Video:

Use libraries like moviepy or ffmpeg to extract audio from the video file.
Speech-to-Text Conversion:

Employ a speech recognition library or API (e.g., SpeechRecognition, Google Speech-to-Text API, or OpenAI Whisper) to transcribe the audio into text.
Text Editor Interface:

Create a simple user interface (UI) for editing the transcribed text using libraries like tkinter or PyQt.
Steps to Build
Extract Audio:

python
Copy code
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

# Load video and extract audio
video = VideoFileClip("sample_video.mp4")
video.audio.write_audiofile("audio.wav")
Convert Audio to Text:

python
Copy code
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Load the audio file
with sr.AudioFile("audio.wav") as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
    print("Transcription: ", text)
Text Editor UI:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk

# Create a basic text editor
def save_text():
    with open("transcription.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write(text_widget.get("1.0", tk.END))

# Create GUI window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Video-to-Text Editor")

# Add text widget
text_widget = tk.Text(root, wrap="word", width=80, height=20)
text_widget.pack(expand=True, fill="both")

# Add Save button
save_button = tk.Button(root, text="Save Transcription", command=save_text)
save_button.pack()

# Populate the text widget with the transcribed text
text_widget.insert("1.0", text)

root.mainloop()
Enhancements:

Add Timestamps: Split the audio into chunks and associate timestamps with the text.
Support Multiple Languages: Use APIs with multi-language support.
Error Handling: Handle noise, accents, and interruptions gracefully.
Tools and Libraries
moviepy: For video processing.
SpeechRecognition: For converting audio to text.
tkinter: For a simple UI.
APIs (Optional): Google Speech-to-Text, OpenAI Whisper for better accuracy.
